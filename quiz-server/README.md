# QuizServer

QuizServer is the *stateless* JSON backend of the ng2d-quiz-app using [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/).
All data for quizzes, questions and answers are stored in a Google Sheet and can thus be easily changed, even on a mobile device.

![QuizServer architecture](/images/readme/QuizServer_architecture.png)

The requirement for the backend is to serve the questions and answers in a *randomized* order, while being stateless at the same time.
This is achieved by using a random seed:
The [QuizApp](../quiz-app/README.md) client app generates a random seed on start-up, which is kept constant over the entire client app lifetime. This seed is sent with every request and used for shuffling the questions and answers.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Sheet Preparation
1. Get the `quiz-app-quizzes` Google Sheet template:
    1. Log in to your Google account.
    2. Open the [quiz-app-quizzes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p7T1wYg6_8ym0JypyryvCsXt7CngNT-Tzyu_RNZ-K0g/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheet template.
    3. Click `File`.
    4. Choose `Make a copy...` and copy the sheet into your Google Drive.
2. Fill the sheet with your quizzes and questions:
    - The template contains all possible setting options. They are mostly self-explaining, so just try out and have fun üôÉ.
    - The first sheet is a short `README`:
    - ![QuizApp Sheet README](images/readme/quiz-app-quizzes-README.jpg)
    - You need to provide images for quizzes and may provide images for questions. The best practice for serving these images is to use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com):
        1. Share the image (*"Anyone with the link can view this file."*) and get the link.
        2. Transform the link as follows: `https://www.dropbox.com/s/<IMAGE_ID>/<IMAGE_NAME>` ‚Üí `https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/<IMAGE_ID>/<IMAGE_NAME>`.
    - ![QuizApp Sheet quizzes](images/readme/quiz-app-quizzes-quizzes.jpg)
    - ![QuizApp Sheet questions](images/readme/quiz-app-quizzes-questions.jpg)
3. Copy the ID of your new `quiz-app-quizzes` sheet, it is needed in the configuration step later. The ID is part of the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit`


## üé¨ Script Installation
1. Get the `quiz-app-server` `Google Script` (`.gs`) code ü§ì:
    1. Log in to your Google Account.
    2. Open the [quiz-app-server](https://script.google.com/d/1aw4MUReEM5EigvdJ7a7oOhvUnHU91UAkoLr-bxRbY66JeDci1iXJQSZO/edit?usp=sharing) Google Apps Script project template.
    3. Click `File`.
    4. Choose `Make a copy...`.
    5. The code can also be found in `quiz-server/src/`.
2. üéõ Configure your new script:
    In `Code.gs` you need to set the `QUESTION_SPREADSHEET_ID`:
    ```gs
    QUESTION_SPREADSHEET_ID = "<YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID>";
    ```


## üöÄ Deployment
The deployment of the QuizServer works as follows:
1. Click `Publish`.
    - ![QuizApp Server deployment 1](images/readme/quiz-app-server-deploy_1.jpg)
2. Choose `Deploy as webapp...`.
3. In the popup make the following settings:
    - ![QuizApp Server deployment 2](images/readme/quiz-app-server-deploy_2.jpg)
    - `Execute the app as:` `Me: (<YOUR_GOOGLE_ACCOUNT>)`
    - `Who has access to the app:`: `Anyone, even anonymous`
4. Click `Deploy`/`Update`. You may have to give permission for the script to access the Google Sheet:
    1. Click `Review Permissions`.
    2. Choose your Google Account.
    3. Since your app isn't verified, click `Advanced` in the bottom left.
    4. Click `Go to quiz-app-server (unsafe)`.
    5. Click `Allow`.
5. Copy the `Current web app URL`. You will need this link for the client `quiz-app` app as `apiEndpoint`.
6. Click `OK`.
